0:05:07.625 --> 0:05:08.792
        So we're gonna go, "Read the

0:05:07.625 --> 0:05:08.792
        ----ing preference sheet..."

0:05:08.792 --> 0:05:10.583
- Twice.

0:05:10.583 --> 0:05:13.125
- The minute Adam doesn't

0:05:10.583 --> 0:05:13.125
    listen to that preference sheet

0:05:13.125 --> 0:05:14.833
 or Hannah screws

0:05:13.125 --> 0:05:14.833
 up this season,

0:05:14.833 --> 0:05:16.667
there's no second chance.

0:05:14.833 --> 0:05:16.667
    All right, really good.

0:05:16.667 --> 0:05:20.000
    - It's really great seeing you.

0:05:16.667 --> 0:05:20.000
        Rock and roll.

0:05:20.000 --> 0:05:22.250
            I'm ready to cook.

0:05:24.833 --> 0:05:26.333
        - Hi.

0:05:24.833 --> 0:05:26.333
        - Hi. Hannah.

0:05:26.333 --> 0:05:27.250
            - Conrad. Nice to meet you.

0:05:26.333 --> 0:05:27.250
- Conrad.

0:05:27.250 --> 0:05:29.167
Nice to meet you. Sandy.

0:05:29.167 --> 0:05:31.375
    And I'm sorry, Conrad,

0:05:29.167 --> 0:05:31.375
    what was your position?

0:05:31.375 --> 0:05:32.792
        - A boatswain.

0:05:31.375 --> 0:05:32.792
            - Boatswain.

0:05:32.792 --> 0:05:34.708
    - Hello.

0:05:32.792 --> 0:05:34.708
        - Hey. Welcome aboard.

0:05:34.708 --> 0:05:36.000
            - Conrad. Nice to meet you.

0:05:34.708 --> 0:05:36.000
            - Well, have a seat.

0:05:36.875 --> 0:05:39.208
        - You're quite young.

0:05:36.875 --> 0:05:39.208
        - I am, I must admit.

0:05:39.208 --> 0:05:41.333
- How old are you?

0:05:39.208 --> 0:05:41.333
        - 23.

0:05:41.333 --> 0:05:42.875
     - I was 19 when

0:05:41.333 --> 0:05:42.875
             I started yachting,

0:05:42.875 --> 0:05:44.542
     and working with

0:05:42.875 --> 0:05:44.542
         a lot of older people,

0:05:44.542 --> 0:05:46.208
     I had to really step up

0:05:44.542 --> 0:05:46.208
         my game quite quickly

0:05:46.208 --> 0:05:47.542
            and grow up quick.

0:05:47.542 --> 0:05:49.042
            - Let's take a walk.

0:05:47.542 --> 0:05:49.042
    - Okay.

0:05:49.042 --> 0:05:51.333
            - I just want to--I

0:05:49.042 --> 0:05:51.333
            have some questions.

0:05:51.333 --> 0:05:54.042
        - Hi.

0:05:51.333 --> 0:05:54.042
            - How you going? I'm Hannah.

0:05:54.042 --> 0:05:56.625
            - Kasey. Nice to meet you.

0:05:54.042 --> 0:05:56.625
            - Kasey, nice to meet you.

0:05:56.625 --> 0:05:59.208
    I'll grab you your uniform.

0:05:56.625 --> 0:05:59.208
Where did you come from?

0:05:59.208 --> 0:06:01.375
            - New York.

0:05:59.208 --> 0:06:01.375
- I love New York.

0:06:01.375 --> 0:06:03.208
 - Out here, I always want

0:06:01.375 --> 0:06:03.208
             to look like a pro.

0:06:03.208 --> 0:06:04.958
    - Yep.

0:06:04.958 --> 0:06:06.542
            - I want to make sure that

0:06:04.958 --> 0:06:06.542
            your distances match mine.

0:06:06.542 --> 0:06:08.333
    - Sure.

0:06:08.333 --> 0:06:10.958
        - Give me the distance

0:06:08.333 --> 0:06:10.958
        from here to that little boat.

0:06:10.958 --> 0:06:12.083
        - 80 meters.

0:06:12.083 --> 0:06:13.917
            - 80 meters?

0:06:12.083 --> 0:06:13.917
    - Yeah.

0:06:13.917 --> 0:06:15.333
        Maybe closer to 100.

0:06:15.333 --> 0:06:17.792
            - Perfect. Learn your boat.

0:06:15.333 --> 0:06:17.792
    - Okay.

0:06:20.667 --> 0:06:22.333
        - High food crew area.

0:06:20.667 --> 0:06:22.333
    - It's massive.

0:06:22.333 --> 0:06:23.542
    Even the laundry room.

0:06:23.542 --> 0:06:25.042
        - Look how big it is.

0:06:25.042 --> 0:06:28.542
        - Your stews are gonna

0:06:25.042 --> 0:06:28.542
            be dancing in here.

0:06:28.542 --> 0:06:30.542
- Welcome aboard.

0:06:28.542 --> 0:06:30.542
- Thank you. Yeah.

0:06:30.542 --> 0:06:31.875
- Sorry, what was

0:06:30.542 --> 0:06:31.875
your name again?

0:06:31.875 --> 0:06:33.083
- How do you spell that?

0:06:33.083 --> 0:06:34.583
            - J-O-A-O. It's...

0:06:34.583 --> 0:06:36.500
            - J-O-A-O. Whereabouts in SA

0:06:34.583 --> 0:06:36.500
        are you from?

0:06:36.500 --> 0:06:39.583
        - I'm not. I'm from Zimbabwe.

0:06:36.500 --> 0:06:39.583
        - My family's from Zimbabwe.

0:06:39.583 --> 0:06:41.417
    - Oh, are they?

0:06:39.583 --> 0:06:41.417
            - Yeah. Whereabouts?

0:06:41.417 --> 0:06:43.167
            - Harare, Salisbury.

0:06:41.417 --> 0:06:43.167
            - Oh, okay.

0:06:43.167 --> 0:06:44.750
    - Yeah.

0:06:44.750 --> 0:06:46.542
        - I've got a soft spot

0:06:44.750 --> 0:06:46.542
for anyone from Zimbabwe,

0:06:46.542 --> 0:06:47.667
         because that's where

0:06:46.542 --> 0:06:47.667
         my parents grew up.

0:06:47.667 --> 0:06:49.417
            It's a landlocked country,

0:06:49.417 --> 0:06:51.167
        so you don't meet too

0:06:49.417 --> 0:06:51.167
many yachties from there,

0:06:51.167 --> 0:06:53.917
        and obviously, it doesn't hurt

0:06:51.167 --> 0:06:53.917
that he's hot as (BLEEP).

0:06:53.917 --> 0:06:56.542
            I'm so happy I have someone

0:06:53.917 --> 0:06:56.542
from Zim on board.

0:06:56.542 --> 0:06:58.292
    - I'm gonna get

0:06:56.542 --> 0:06:58.292
    definitely lost in here.

0:06:58.292 --> 0:06:59.792
- Conrad.

0:06:58.292 --> 0:06:59.792
        Nice to meet you, man.

0:06:59.792 --> 0:07:01.542
- Adam, nice to meet you.

0:06:59.792 --> 0:07:01.542
            - Nice to meet you.

0:07:01.542 --> 0:07:03.250
        - I'm so jealous of your name.

0:07:01.542 --> 0:07:03.250
            - Huh? Why?

0:07:03.250 --> 0:07:06.792
            - 'Cause it has "rad" in it.

0:07:03.250 --> 0:07:06.792
            - Okay. Another TV.

0:07:06.792 --> 0:07:09.958
        This is the first time

0:07:06.792 --> 0:07:09.958
            I'm working on a huge boat.

0:07:09.958 --> 0:07:13.250
        The boats I work on back home

0:07:09.958 --> 0:07:13.250
are like 100 feet,

0:07:13.250 --> 0:07:15.042
            so it's very intimidating,

0:07:15.042 --> 0:07:19.208
but I've been in yachting

0:07:15.042 --> 0:07:19.208
        for four years, and I'm smart.

0:07:19.208 --> 0:07:20.792
            It's like a treasure hunt.

0:07:20.792 --> 0:07:22.625
Let's go and start

0:07:20.792 --> 0:07:22.625
        at the top, actually,

0:07:22.625 --> 0:07:24.583
        and we can work our way down.

0:07:31.958 --> 0:07:34.083
        - Okay, cool.

0:07:31.958 --> 0:07:34.083
        - Growing up in Zim was tough,

0:07:34.083 --> 0:07:36.583
 from politically,

0:07:34.083 --> 0:07:36.583
 economically, everything.

0:07:36.583 --> 0:07:38.333
- It's in great shape.

0:07:38.333 --> 0:07:40.625
Just rinse and wipe and get

0:07:38.333 --> 0:07:40.625
it looking nice and pretty.

0:07:40.625 --> 0:07:43.250
- There's no way of moving

0:07:40.625 --> 0:07:43.250
    forward in the country.

0:07:43.250 --> 0:07:44.917
    You're always at a standstill,

0:07:44.917 --> 0:07:47.833
            and yachting was my only way

0:07:44.917 --> 0:07:47.833
    to get out of Zimbabwe.

0:07:47.833 --> 0:07:49.958
            - It's gonna be interesting

0:07:47.833 --> 0:07:49.958
            doing a rinse-down in a day.

0:07:49.958 --> 0:07:50.958
            - Tell me about it.

0:07:50.958 --> 0:07:52.333
        - Hi.

0:07:50.958 --> 0:07:52.333
        - Hi.

0:07:52.333 --> 0:07:54.000
    - How you going?

0:07:52.333 --> 0:07:54.000
            - Good. How are you?

0:07:54.000 --> 0:07:55.917
            - Good. I'm Hannah.

0:07:54.000 --> 0:07:55.917
            - Brooke. Nice to meet you.

0:07:55.917 --> 0:07:58.083
    - Nice to meet you, Brooke.

0:07:55.917 --> 0:07:58.083
    Do you want to have a seat?

0:07:58.083 --> 0:07:59.500
        - Yeah. Sure.

0:07:59.500 --> 0:08:00.500
        - So how long have you

0:07:59.500 --> 0:08:00.500
worked on yachts?

0:08:00.500 --> 0:08:02.458
- Three and a bit years now.

0:08:02.458 --> 0:08:04.833
            Started out as a junior stew

0:08:02.458 --> 0:08:04.833
        on a really big sailing yacht,

0:08:04.833 --> 0:08:08.000
    and then I got a chief stew job

0:08:04.833 --> 0:08:08.000
            on a smaller sailing yacht.

0:08:08.000 --> 0:08:09.417
- Okay. What was the

0:08:08.000 --> 0:08:09.417
large sailing yacht?

0:08:09.417 --> 0:08:10.792
- [inaudible], it was called.

0:08:10.792 --> 0:08:12.333
        - Oh, my gosh.

0:08:10.792 --> 0:08:12.333
Do you know Sophie Page?

0:08:12.333 --> 0:08:13.792
- Yeah, yeah.

0:08:13.792 --> 0:08:14.792
- Sophie Page is one

0:08:13.792 --> 0:08:14.792
of my best friends.

0:08:14.792 --> 0:08:16.250
- Really?

0:08:16.250 --> 0:08:17.375
            - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

0:08:16.250 --> 0:08:17.375
            - I replaced Soph.

0:08:17.375 --> 0:08:19.333
        - Really? She quit [inaudible]

0:08:19.333 --> 0:08:21.375
            to come to Australia this

0:08:19.333 --> 0:08:21.375
    summer to spend summer with me.

0:08:21.375 --> 0:08:22.708
- Really?

0:08:22.708 --> 0:08:24.542
    - Yeah.

0:08:22.708 --> 0:08:24.542
- When I first told my mum

0:08:24.542 --> 0:08:26.042
 that I was gonna pursue

0:08:24.542 --> 0:08:26.042
 this life, she was like,

0:08:26.042 --> 0:08:27.833
     "I'll see you in three weeks,"

0:08:27.833 --> 0:08:31.708
            and then 3 1/2 years later,

0:08:27.833 --> 0:08:31.708
I've still not come back.

0:08:31.708 --> 0:08:33.833
    The standards on

0:08:31.708 --> 0:08:33.833
[inaudible] were so high.

0:08:33.833 --> 0:08:35.167
    - Yeah.

0:08:33.833 --> 0:08:35.167
- But, I mean, it's like,

0:08:35.167 --> 0:08:36.667
            this is a much bigger boat.

0:08:36.667 --> 0:08:38.042
    - Yeah.

0:08:36.667 --> 0:08:38.042
    - This is obviously a real big,

0:08:38.042 --> 0:08:39.333
    like, nice step for me.

0:08:39.333 --> 0:08:40.958
    - Good.

0:08:39.333 --> 0:08:40.958
            - Last year,

0:08:40.958 --> 0:08:43.708
        I certainly didn't get

0:08:40.958 --> 0:08:43.708
along with my stewardess.

0:08:43.708 --> 0:08:45.875
    - I feel this season you've

0:08:43.708 --> 0:08:45.875
been a lousy chief stew.

0:08:45.875 --> 0:08:47.708
I don't feel like you're

0:08:45.875 --> 0:08:47.708
pulling your weight.

0:08:47.708 --> 0:08:49.292
    - Okay.

0:08:49.292 --> 0:08:51.208
So I'm hoping this year,

0:08:49.292 --> 0:08:51.208
we can go to bed at night

0:08:51.208 --> 0:08:53.375
        and not worry about waking up

0:08:51.208 --> 0:08:53.375
        with nine daggers in my back.

0:08:53.375 --> 0:08:54.875
        - Hi.

0:08:53.375 --> 0:08:54.875
        - Hi.

0:08:54.875 --> 0:08:56.375
- Brooke, Kelsey.

0:08:54.875 --> 0:08:56.375
- Oh, lovely to meet you.

0:08:56.375 --> 0:08:58.708
    - Kasey.

0:08:56.375 --> 0:08:58.708
            - Oh, Kasey. Sorry.

0:08:58.708 --> 0:09:02.000
            - It's okay.

0:08:58.708 --> 0:09:02.000
    - [indistinct] name so quickly.

0:09:02.000 --> 0:09:04.000
- What's up, man?

0:09:02.000 --> 0:09:04.000
Conrad. Nice to meet you.

0:09:04.000 --> 0:09:05.250
        - Conrad. Colin. How are you?

            Where are you from?

0:12:55.708 --> 0:12:58.542
            - I'm from New York.

0:12:55.708 --> 0:12:58.542
            Where are you from?

0:12:58.542 --> 0:12:59.708
    - South Africa.

0:12:59.708 --> 0:13:02.125
            - Oh, nice.

0:12:59.708 --> 0:13:02.125
    - Yeah, and you?

0:13:02.125 --> 0:13:04.458
            - Zimbabwe.

0:13:02.125 --> 0:13:04.458
            - You lie.

0:13:04.458 --> 0:13:06.125
        - No, I don't "lah."

0:13:22.833 --> 0:13:24.500
        - Yes, we do.

0:13:24.500 --> 0:13:26.500
        And yet we still get confused

0:13:24.500 --> 0:13:26.500
            with South Africans.

0:13:26.500 --> 0:13:28.583
            - What do you mean?

0:13:34.000 --> 0:13:35.833
     - All crew, all crew,

0:13:35.833 --> 0:13:38.125
             we've got provisions

0:13:35.833 --> 0:13:38.125
 arriving on the aft deck.

0:13:38.125 --> 0:13:41.250
            - So these are going

0:13:38.125 --> 0:13:41.250
in the main salon.

0:13:42.833 --> 0:13:44.250
            - No, I can do it.

0:13:44.250 --> 0:13:46.458
    - Jesus Christ.

0:13:44.250 --> 0:13:46.458
            - Just grab and go.

0:13:46.458 --> 0:13:47.833
            - Think I might have

0:13:46.458 --> 0:13:47.833
        over-ordered.

0:13:47.833 --> 0:13:49.167
    - Loving the headband.

0:13:49.167 --> 0:13:51.042
        - I know, it's gotten

0:13:49.167 --> 0:13:51.042
too crazy.

0:13:51.042 --> 0:13:52.875
    - Oh, hey, hey.

0:13:52.875 --> 0:13:54.667
        - Is that everything?

0:13:52.875 --> 0:13:54.667
Okay, cool, yeah.

0:13:54.667 --> 0:13:56.542
            - All right.

0:13:54.667 --> 0:13:56.542
            Let's get back to...

0:13:56.542 --> 0:13:58.625
        - Girls, Hannah, if you could

0:13:56.542 --> 0:13:58.625
        just pop up to the main salon,

0:13:58.625 --> 0:14:01.667
        we're gonna do a stew

0:13:58.625 --> 0:14:01.667
            meeting now.

0:14:01.667 --> 0:14:03.833
        We'll sit down

0:14:01.667 --> 0:14:03.833
at the table here.

0:14:03.833 --> 0:14:08.333
So basically, you're mid,

0:14:03.833 --> 0:14:08.333
        you're morning, and I'm late.

0:14:08.333 --> 0:14:09.792
        Daily tasks.

0:14:09.792 --> 0:14:11.792
        So you get up at 6:30

0:14:09.792 --> 0:14:11.792
    in the morning,

0:14:11.792 --> 0:14:13.375
        turn the laundry over,

0:14:11.792 --> 0:14:13.375
do the...

0:14:13.375 --> 0:14:16.375
    [indistinct overlapping speech]

0:14:16.375 --> 0:14:18.542
    turn-downs, just

0:14:16.375 --> 0:14:18.542
        quickly turn the laundry over,

0:14:18.542 --> 0:14:19.875
            and then you're off to bed.

0:14:19.875 --> 0:14:21.208
    - Okay.

0:14:21.208 --> 0:14:24.042
        - How are you

0:14:21.208 --> 0:14:24.042
    at your cocktail skills?

0:14:24.042 --> 0:14:26.875
- I'm a bartender.

0:14:24.042 --> 0:14:26.875
        Mostly Jack and Cokes.

0:14:26.875 --> 0:14:28.542
        - Okay. And yourself?

0:14:28.542 --> 0:14:30.375
        - Yeah, good.

0:14:28.542 --> 0:14:30.375
        - You're good?

0:14:30.375 --> 0:14:32.208
        - I love making them.

0:14:30.375 --> 0:14:32.208
        - I much prefer drinking them

0:14:32.208 --> 0:14:33.917
than making them.

0:14:33.917 --> 0:14:37.583
        My job is to make sure

0:14:33.917 --> 0:14:37.583
        the boat runs really smoothly.

0:14:37.583 --> 0:14:39.083
            Sometimes I can be

0:14:37.583 --> 0:14:39.083
            a little bit short,

0:14:39.083 --> 0:14:40.917
    so don't take it

0:14:39.083 --> 0:14:40.917
at all personally.

0:14:40.917 --> 0:14:44.500
            I appreciate the hard work,

0:14:40.917 --> 0:14:44.500
        and I know it's a lot,

0:14:44.500 --> 0:14:47.208
            but we've just got

0:14:44.500 --> 0:14:47.208
            to get through it.

0:14:52.833 --> 0:14:55.208
    - Oh, those are awesome.

0:14:52.833 --> 0:14:55.208
    Is that bluefin?

0:14:55.208 --> 0:14:57.250
            Beef ribs.

0:15:00.417 --> 0:15:04.208
    - Adam, Hannah, Conrad,

0:15:00.417 --> 0:15:04.208
please come to the bridge.

0:15:04.208 --> 0:15:05.583
 - Okay.

0:15:05.583 --> 0:15:08.042
            Okay, cool.

0:15:05.583 --> 0:15:08.042
        Good work today, guys.

0:15:12.833 --> 0:15:14.417
        - So it's our first charter.

0:15:14.417 --> 0:15:16.750

0:15:29.750 --> 0:15:31.083
        She's looking forward

    to experiencing

0:15:31.083 --> 0:15:32.458
        the sights in style.

    - We're heading to Capri

0:15:32.458 --> 0:15:33.958

    - Yeah, so they board at noon.

0:15:35.625 --> 0:15:37.917
        As soon as the luggage is on,

0:15:35.625 --> 0:15:37.917
you start bringing

0:15:37.917 --> 0:15:40.292
            the passerelle in, and then

0:15:37.917 --> 0:15:40.292

no chicken, no white rice.

0:15:43.792 --> 0:15:45.875
            - Guests would like

0:15:43.792 --> 0:15:45.875
            to have water toys.

0:15:45.875 --> 0:15:47.583
- What type of water toys

0:15:45.875 --> 0:15:47.583

0:16:10.917 --> 0:16:12.667
[phone dings and buzzing]

0:16:12.667 --> 0:16:15.333
    - Recently, I've started dating

0:16:12.667 --> 0:16:15.333
one of my oldest friends,

0:16:15.333 --> 0:16:19.083
    and this will be the first time

0:16:15.333 --> 0:16:19.083
        that we've been apart.

0:16:22.458 --> 0:16:24.167
        Oh, God. Why?

0:16:24.167 --> 0:16:25.792
     - Do you want a glass of wine?

0:16:24.167 --> 0:16:25.792
         - (BLEEP) yes.

0:16:25.792 --> 0:16:28.458
    Mm-hmm. Hello.

0:16:28.458 --> 0:16:29.792
        - Hey. How's it going?

0:16:28.458 --> 0:16:29.792
        - Hey, thanks.

0:16:29.792 --> 0:16:31.333
    - Step into our offices.

0:16:29.792 --> 0:16:31.333
    - I am.

0:16:31.333 --> 0:16:32.500
        - You glad to be done for the

0:16:31.333 --> 0:16:32.500
            day? - Yeah.

0:16:32.500 --> 0:16:33.833
    - Yeah, so not a bad first day.

0:16:33.833 --> 0:16:35.583
- Yeah, the boat's

0:16:33.833 --> 0:16:35.583
        looking good.

0:16:35.583 --> 0:16:37.958
For the first time

0:16:35.583 --> 0:16:37.958
        in the last few years,

0:16:37.958 --> 0:16:40.708
we actually got delivered

0:16:37.958 --> 0:16:40.708
            a boat that's in good shape.

0:16:40.708 --> 0:16:42.458
    Oh, by the way,

0:16:40.708 --> 0:16:42.458
    how old are you?

0:16:42.458 --> 0:16:44.333
        - 23.

0:16:42.458 --> 0:16:44.333
    - What?! You're joking!

0:16:44.333 --> 0:16:45.875
            23 years old, mate?

0:16:45.875 --> 0:16:47.375
    - Yeah.

0:16:47.375 --> 0:16:48.708
            - Oh, I'm gonna look

0:16:47.375 --> 0:16:48.708
            at you differently.

0:16:48.708 --> 0:16:50.375
    - I hate it when someone

0:16:48.708 --> 0:16:50.375
brings up my age.

0:16:50.375 --> 0:16:52.042
- How long have you been

0:16:50.375 --> 0:16:52.042
in yachting for?

0:16:52.042 --> 0:16:54.458
        - That's why he's got

0:16:52.042 --> 0:16:54.458
        the baby face.

0:16:54.458 --> 0:16:56.000
- 3 1/2--okay, so you have

0:16:54.458 --> 0:16:56.000
    been yachting for that--

0:16:56.000 --> 0:16:57.708
        - Yeah, yeah.

0:16:56.000 --> 0:16:57.708
            - Okay. And as a boatswain?

0:16:57.708 --> 0:16:59.875
- A boatswain for

0:16:57.708 --> 0:16:59.875
the past year--

0:16:59.875 --> 0:17:01.667
            just over a year and a half.

0:16:59.875 --> 0:17:01.667
            - Okay. That's cool.

0:17:01.667 --> 0:17:03.667
- Accept it for what it is

0:17:01.667 --> 0:17:03.667
and just shut up.

0:17:03.667 --> 0:17:05.542
    - That's why you've got

0:17:03.667 --> 0:17:05.542
a sweet baby face.

0:17:05.542 --> 0:17:08.125
            - That's because you haven't

0:17:05.542 --> 0:17:08.125
        hit puberty yet, mate.

0:17:12.167 --> 0:17:13.917
 - I have a visual

0:17:12.167 --> 0:17:13.917
         on our guests.

0:17:15.292 --> 0:17:17.708
             - All crew, all crew

0:17:15.292 --> 0:17:17.708
     to the aft deck.

0:17:17.708 --> 0:17:19.125
            - Just what I need.

0:17:23.750 --> 0:17:24.500
 - I'll probably change in front

0:17:24.333 --> 0:17:24.500
 of you.

0:17:26.375 --> 0:17:28.000
        Probably see more than

0:17:26.375 --> 0:17:28.000
        you wanted to,

0:17:28.000 --> 0:17:29.917
        - That's okay.

0:17:28.000 --> 0:17:29.917
        I used to do pageants, and so,

0:17:29.917 --> 0:17:31.417
    like, all the girls were always

0:17:29.917 --> 0:17:31.417
        naked in front of each other.

0:17:31.417 --> 0:17:32.833
    - Oh, you did pageants?

0:17:32.833 --> 0:17:34.917
    - For the Miss New York

0:17:32.833 --> 0:17:34.917
            USA pageant.

0:17:34.917 --> 0:17:37.083
     Because I did pageants,

0:17:34.917 --> 0:17:37.083
             people think that I'm dumb,

0:17:37.083 --> 0:17:38.917
but I went to Stony Brook

0:17:37.083 --> 0:17:38.917
            University--it's on

0:17:38.917 --> 0:17:42.333
    Long Island--and

0:17:38.917 --> 0:17:42.333
        I got a degree in psychology.

0:17:42.333 --> 0:17:43.875
        I was a semifinalist.

0:17:45.667 --> 0:17:46.917
 - Hello.

0:17:46.917 --> 0:17:48.375
- You look comfy.

0:17:48.375 --> 0:17:49.708
    - Oh, that looks

0:17:48.375 --> 0:17:49.708
            really comfortable.

0:17:49.708 --> 0:17:51.083
    - Yeah, it feels

0:17:49.708 --> 0:17:51.083
    so much better.

0:17:51.083 --> 0:17:52.333
        - Yes.

0:17:51.083 --> 0:17:52.333
            - Yes, I do.

0:17:52.333 --> 0:17:54.167
    - Are you guys single?

0:18:01.583 --> 0:18:04.708
        - Oh!

0:18:01.583 --> 0:18:04.708

0:21:31.833 --> 0:21:35.000
    This is the main salon.

0:21:35.000 --> 0:21:36.500
            - It's very lovely.

0:21:36.500 --> 0:21:37.583
            - And through here

            - Oh, is this nice?

0:21:40.125 --> 0:21:42.167
            - Fabulous.

0:21:42.167 --> 0:21:43.667
        - And in there we have

0:21:42.167 --> 0:21:43.667
        the bathroom.

0:21:43.667 --> 0:21:45.125
- You have to take a bath

0:21:43.667 --> 0:21:45.125
    on a boat, okay?

0:21:45.125 --> 0:21:47.000
            It's such a rarity.

0:21:47.000 --> 0:21:49.458
            - Deck crew, change quickly.

0:21:47.000 --> 0:21:49.458
            We're gonna leave the dock.

0:21:49.458 --> 0:21:51.833
        - Show you the

0:21:49.458 --> 0:21:51.833
cabins downstairs.

0:21:51.833 --> 0:21:53.625
- Oh, isn't this pretty?

0:21:53.625 --> 0:21:55.167
            - We've got two doubles here

0:21:53.625 --> 0:21:55.167
and two singles in there.

0:21:55.167 --> 0:21:56.833
- How do we pick a room?

0:21:56.833 --> 0:22:00.750
            - Throw your purse in there

0:21:56.833 --> 0:22:00.750
and you go for it.

0:22:00.750 --> 0:22:02.792
        - Yeah. Yeah.

0:22:00.750 --> 0:22:02.792
            I'm gonna come straight out.

0:22:02.792 --> 0:22:04.333
            You're gonna tell me

0:22:02.792 --> 0:22:04.333
        the distances

0:22:04.333 --> 0:22:05.792
        off the boat in front of me.

0:22:05.792 --> 0:22:07.625
            - Okay. Yep, Sandy,

        all clear to release.

0:22:09.667 --> 0:22:11.958
     that you've never taken it off

0:22:11.958 --> 0:22:13.875
 the dock with a new crew,

0:22:11.958 --> 0:22:13.875
     you're nervous,

0:22:13.875 --> 0:22:15.458
and if you say you're not,

0:22:13.875 --> 0:22:15.458
            you're full of sh--.

0:22:15.458 --> 0:22:16.833
- Releasing line.

0:22:15.458 --> 0:22:16.833
- Drop it.

0:22:16.833 --> 0:22:17.875
        - Dropping it.

0:22:16.833 --> 0:22:17.875
        - Clear, Cap.

0:22:17.875 --> 0:22:19.208
    - I'm going into gear.

0:22:19.208 --> 0:22:20.292
            - Make sure you move

0:22:19.208 --> 0:22:20.292
    all the fenders.

0:22:20.292 --> 0:22:21.875
            Drop them down if need be.

0:22:21.875 --> 0:22:23.708
    - The marina in Naples,

0:22:21.875 --> 0:22:23.708
the vessels are so tight,

0:22:23.708 --> 0:22:29.208
            so the communication

0:22:23.708 --> 0:22:29.208
has to be spot-on.

0:22:29.208 --> 0:22:31.458
        - 1 1/2 meters

0:22:29.208 --> 0:22:31.458
on the starboard.

0:22:31.458 --> 0:22:33.333
            Watch over the side

0:22:31.458 --> 0:22:33.333
until it's clear.

0:22:33.333 --> 0:22:34.875
- Would you ladies

0:22:33.333 --> 0:22:34.875
        like a little top-off?

0:22:34.875 --> 0:22:35.958
    - I'll have a top-off.

0:22:35.958 --> 0:22:37.458
    - We'll have a top-off.

0:22:37.458 --> 0:22:39.125
    - Okay, you're all clear

0:22:37.458 --> 0:22:39.125
            to swing. All clear.

0:22:39.125 --> 0:22:40.833
     - Well done, everyone.

0:22:40.833 --> 0:22:43.542
        So far, taking it off the dock

0:22:40.833 --> 0:22:43.542
            was a piece of cake.

0:22:43.542 --> 0:22:45.500
- Do you have nuts

0:22:43.542 --> 0:22:45.500
        with the bar?

0:22:45.500 --> 0:22:47.000
        - Do you have nuts on a boat?

0:22:45.500 --> 0:22:47.000
- Cashews?

0:22:47.000 --> 0:22:50.208
Do you have nuts?

0:22:47.000 --> 0:22:50.208
- Yeah, of course.

0:22:50.208 --> 0:22:51.792
- Oh, let's go upstairs.

0:22:51.792 --> 0:22:53.000
- I'll bring you up maybe

0:22:51.792 --> 0:22:53.000
            a little free plate

0:22:53.000 --> 0:22:53.917
            or something and some nuts?

0:22:53.917 --> 0:22:55.083
        - Yes, and some nuts.

0:22:55.083 --> 0:22:56.583
Thank you.

0:22:55.083 --> 0:22:56.583
    - Okay.

0:22:56.583 --> 0:22:58.375
        - It's flat calm. Very nice.

0:23:00.875 --> 0:23:02.083
            - It's so calm here.

0:23:00.875 --> 0:23:02.083
            There's no swells, nothing.

0:23:02.083 --> 0:23:03.542
    - I love it. This is gorgeous.

0:23:03.542 --> 0:23:05.542
            - Hi. How are you?

0:23:03.542 --> 0:23:05.542
            - A little seasick.

0:23:05.542 --> 0:23:07.417
- Oh, no.

0:23:05.542 --> 0:23:07.417
    - I have Dramamine that I took.

0:23:07.417 --> 0:23:08.917
- If you need to sit down,

0:23:08.917 --> 0:23:10.708
just have some ginger ale,

0:23:08.917 --> 0:23:10.708
go outside.

0:23:10.708 --> 0:23:14.750
            - Can we get fruit, cheese,

0:23:10.708 --> 0:23:14.750
            crackers, and nuts?

0:23:14.750 --> 0:23:16.500
    - Okay.

0:23:18.917 --> 0:23:21.417
    - This is the fun part.

0:23:21.417 --> 0:23:24.708
- I'm waiting for my nuts.

0:23:21.417 --> 0:23:24.708
Where are my nuts?

0:23:24.708 --> 0:23:27.875
        - I have some stale pistachios

0:23:24.708 --> 0:23:27.875
    with my edibles.

0:23:32.917 --> 0:23:35.042
- She's seasick?

0:23:35.042 --> 0:23:37.125
- What's taking so long?

0:23:37.125 --> 0:23:38.958
    - I'll take care of it.

0:23:37.125 --> 0:23:38.958
            - Yeah, go take care of it,

0:23:38.958 --> 0:23:40.625
        [inaudible].

0:23:40.625 --> 0:23:42.125
        - I'm handling it. I got this.

0:23:40.625 --> 0:23:42.125
I know what to do.

0:23:42.125 --> 0:23:43.542
    Excuse me, could we have

0:23:42.125 --> 0:23:43.542
    someone upstairs

0:23:43.542 --> 0:23:45.542
            to make sure

0:23:43.542 --> 0:23:45.542
    our glasses are tended?

0:23:45.542 --> 0:23:47.583
    - I'm just about to grab

0:23:45.542 --> 0:23:47.583
            your champagne as we speak.

0:23:47.583 --> 0:23:50.250
            - Excellent.

0:23:47.583 --> 0:23:50.250
And we need some protein.

0:23:50.250 --> 0:23:51.958
- Yeah, the chef's getting

0:23:50.250 --> 0:23:51.958
your platters together now.

0:23:51.958 --> 0:23:53.625
        - Excellent.

0:23:53.625 --> 0:23:54.958
            - And the nuts? Do you have

0:23:53.625 --> 0:23:54.958
            the nuts coming too?

0:23:54.958 --> 0:23:56.125
        - Yes.

0:23:54.958 --> 0:23:56.125
        - Okay, 'cause I asked

0:23:56.125 --> 0:23:57.958
    for that about ten minutes ago.

0:23:57.958 --> 0:23:59.292
    - [inaudible] crackers?

0:23:57.958 --> 0:23:59.292
        - You could just find me some.

0:23:59.292 --> 0:24:00.542
            Check the crew mess, maybe?

0:24:00.542 --> 0:24:02.625
    - Okay.

0:24:00.542 --> 0:24:02.625
- Okay. Thank you.

0:24:02.625 --> 0:24:05.625
- Conrad, final color in

0:24:02.625 --> 0:24:05.625
the water will be green.

0:24:05.625 --> 0:24:07.458
            - Copy. When we come

0:24:05.625 --> 0:24:07.458
            into the anchorage,

0:24:07.458 --> 0:24:09.917
            we have to lower the anchor

0:24:07.458 --> 0:24:09.917
to the waterline.

0:24:12.083 --> 0:24:13.750
    - Yeah. Yeah, I'm getting there

0:24:12.083 --> 0:24:13.750
in a minute, mate.

0:24:13.750 --> 0:24:16.500
    - You're gonna drop two

0:24:13.750 --> 0:24:16.500
    out super quick, okay?

0:24:16.500 --> 0:24:18.208
        - How do you know how long--

0:24:20.583 --> 0:24:22.167
    - "Rub your balls with grease."

0:24:20.583 --> 0:24:22.167
    Have you heard of that?

0:24:22.167 --> 0:24:23.333
        - No.

0:24:22.167 --> 0:24:23.333
        - [inaudible].

0:24:23.333 --> 0:24:24.792
- So she'll call a color.

0:24:24.792 --> 0:24:26.833
    Okay, so let three shots down.

0:24:26.833 --> 0:24:28.625
You'll know that's

0:24:26.833 --> 0:24:28.625
"Rub your balls."

0:24:28.625 --> 0:24:30.500
            That's blue.

0:24:28.625 --> 0:24:30.500
            Once the blue goes through,

0:24:30.500 --> 0:24:32.833
        let it go for a little while,

0:24:30.500 --> 0:24:32.833
        and then shut it off,

0:24:32.833 --> 0:24:34.583
'cause she wants the blue

0:24:32.833 --> 0:24:34.583
on the waterline.

0:24:34.583 --> 0:24:35.625
- Got it. Got it.

0:24:34.583 --> 0:24:35.625
            - As she mentioned just now.

0:24:35.625 --> 0:24:36.792
        Yeah.

0:24:36.792 --> 0:24:38.250
- Got it.

0:24:36.792 --> 0:24:38.250
- She wants green.

0:24:38.250 --> 0:24:39.583
        - No, no, no.

0:24:38.250 --> 0:24:39.583
            I'm just saying--no,

0:24:39.583 --> 0:24:41.333
            when--yeah,

0:24:39.583 --> 0:24:41.333
            she wants green now.

0:24:41.333 --> 0:24:42.833
    - Yeah, using it as an example.

0:24:41.333 --> 0:24:42.833
        I got you. I got you.

0:24:42.833 --> 0:24:43.917
    - Yeah.

0:24:42.833 --> 0:24:43.917
    - Let me explain for next time.

0:24:43.917 --> 0:24:44.917
            Okay, cool.

0:24:44.917 --> 0:24:46.625
            - Joao works great.

0:24:46.625 --> 0:24:50.167
        I can see that he wants to be

0:24:46.625 --> 0:24:50.167
    boatswain, but he's not.

0:24:50.167 --> 0:24:51.833
Yeah, so eventually we'll

0:24:50.167 --> 0:24:51.833
            [inaudible] and go.

0:24:51.833 --> 0:24:53.250
        - We're going on 20 minutes,

0:24:53.250 --> 0:24:54.583
            and I still haven't

0:24:53.250 --> 0:24:54.583
            had my nuts.

0:24:54.583 --> 0:24:56.250
        - I think it should be

0:24:54.583 --> 0:24:56.250
mentioned,

0:24:56.250 --> 0:24:57.250
        because everyone needs

0:24:56.250 --> 0:24:57.250
to know your expectations.

0:24:57.250 --> 0:24:58.667
    Like, boom, boom, boom.

0:24:58.667 --> 0:24:59.833
        - How are you feeling,

0:24:58.667 --> 0:24:59.833
            sweetheart?

0:24:59.833 --> 0:25:01.125
            - Not well.

0:25:01.125 --> 0:25:02.958
            - Not good?

0:25:01.125 --> 0:25:02.958
- This is day one,

0:25:02.958 --> 0:25:07.375
        and I'm already a stewardess

0:25:02.958 --> 0:25:07.375
        down. That really scares me.

0:25:07.375 --> 0:25:09.708
- Here you go, sweetheart,

0:25:07.375 --> 0:25:09.708
            just in case, okay?

0:25:09.708 --> 0:25:11.375
- Thank you so much.

0:25:11.375 --> 0:25:15.167
        - I guess there's a lot to do.

0:25:11.375 --> 0:25:15.167
            - It's what we got.

0:25:15.167 --> 0:25:16.167
    - Yeah?

0:25:15.167 --> 0:25:16.167
    - Yeah.

0:25:16.167 --> 0:25:17.667
    - Okay.

0:25:17.667 --> 0:25:19.208
            - Can you just take

0:25:17.667 --> 0:25:19.208
            the nuts up for now?

0:25:19.208 --> 0:25:20.208
    - Just take all of this.

0:25:19.208 --> 0:25:20.208
It's ready to go.

0:25:20.208 --> 0:25:21.708
    - Yeah?

0:25:20.208 --> 0:25:21.708
    - Yep.

0:25:21.708 --> 0:25:22.625
- I'll just go set

0:25:21.708 --> 0:25:22.625
            the plates up, okay?

0:25:22.625 --> 0:25:24.000
            - This can go too.

0:25:24.000 --> 0:25:26.000
        - Okay. I'll be back.

0:25:24.000 --> 0:25:26.000
    - Hello?

0:25:26.000 --> 0:25:28.125
    - Is there an intercom system?

0:25:26.000 --> 0:25:28.125
    - Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

0:25:28.125 --> 0:25:30.792
        - I'll grab the rest.

0:25:30.792 --> 0:25:33.042
        - Would you like it over there

0:25:30.792 --> 0:25:33.042
    or set up here?

0:25:33.042 --> 0:25:34.208
        - Over here.

0:25:33.042 --> 0:25:34.208
        - Over here.

0:25:34.208 --> 0:25:35.208
        - Over here.

0:25:34.208 --> 0:25:35.208
        - Over there?

0:25:35.208 --> 0:25:36.833
        - Thank you.

0:25:36.833 --> 0:25:37.875
- Those are for the shells

0:25:36.833 --> 0:25:37.875
of the pistachios.

0:25:37.875 --> 0:25:40.500
    - Okay.

0:25:40.500 --> 0:25:43.250
- There's still not nuts.

0:25:40.500 --> 0:25:43.250
What is going on?

0:25:43.250 --> 0:25:44.667
        - Oh, here they come.

0:25:43.250 --> 0:25:44.667
        - Oh, here they come.

0:25:44.667 --> 0:25:45.750
    Here it comes.

0:25:45.750 --> 0:25:47.167
- There comes your nuts.

0:25:47.167 --> 0:25:48.917
            - They should have

0:25:47.167 --> 0:25:48.917
            had that prepared.

0:25:48.917 --> 0:25:50.750
            - Some cheese and biscuits.

0:25:48.917 --> 0:25:50.750
            - Who's bringing the nuts?

0:25:50.750 --> 0:25:52.583
        - Where are my nuts?

0:25:52.583 --> 0:25:54.250
    - Can you go get

0:25:52.583 --> 0:25:54.250
        some nuts immediately?

0:25:54.250 --> 0:25:55.583
        - Brooke's going down

0:25:54.250 --> 0:25:55.583
            to get them.

0:25:55.583 --> 0:25:57.500
- Now we're going

0:25:55.583 --> 0:25:57.500
        on 25 minutes.

0:25:57.500 --> 0:26:00.083
    - Nuts.

0:25:57.500 --> 0:26:00.083
        - Your nuts are coming, bitch.

0:26:00.083 --> 0:26:02.417
            Calm down.

0:26:02.417 --> 0:26:04.375
        - She's not doing a good job.

0:26:12.458 --> 0:26:13.292
 - Nuts, please, immediately.

0:26:13.000 --> 0:26:13.292
Nuts. Like, nuts.

0:26:14.917 --> 0:26:16.708
    Like, protein.

0:26:16.708 --> 0:26:18.500
            - Yes, she's--Brooke's going

0:26:16.708 --> 0:26:18.500
down to get them.

0:26:18.500 --> 0:26:19.708
        Okay?

0:26:19.708 --> 0:26:21.125
        - She's not doing a good job.

0:26:21.125 --> 0:26:22.958
    - The olives are

0:26:21.125 --> 0:26:22.958
delicious, though.

0:26:22.958 --> 0:26:24.958
        - Here come the nuts.

0:26:24.958 --> 0:26:26.708
    - Are peanuts or walnuts okay?

0:26:24.958 --> 0:26:26.708
    - Nuts, nuts, nuts, nuts, nuts.

0:26:26.708 --> 0:26:29.583
            - Salted peanuts or walnuts?

0:26:26.708 --> 0:26:29.583
    - Is that all you have?

0:26:29.583 --> 0:26:31.583
Do you have, like,

0:26:29.583 --> 0:26:31.583
    honey roasted anything?

0:26:31.583 --> 0:26:34.042
- I cannot believe she had

0:26:31.583 --> 0:26:34.042
        to wait for the nuts.

0:26:34.042 --> 0:26:35.750
        - She wanted almonds.

0:26:35.750 --> 0:26:38.458
    - These little ----ing bitches.

0:26:35.750 --> 0:26:38.458
    - What?

0:26:38.458 --> 0:26:41.958
- She's like, "Nuts, now!"

0:26:38.458 --> 0:26:41.958
    - Jeez.

0:26:44.708 --> 0:26:47.750
         - Adam, Adam, Hannah.

0:26:44.708 --> 0:26:47.750
            - Go ahead.

0:26:47.750 --> 0:26:49.125
         - I reckon I'm good

0:26:47.750 --> 0:26:49.125
         to feed the guests.

0:26:49.125 --> 0:26:51.208
        - Let's do it.

0:26:49.125 --> 0:26:51.208
    - Oh, beautiful.

0:26:51.208 --> 0:26:52.750
            We're ready for over here?

0:26:52.750 --> 0:26:54.125
        - Yeah, yeah, if you're ready

0:26:52.750 --> 0:26:54.125
            to sit down.

0:26:54.125 --> 0:26:56.208
            - I am quite hungry

0:26:54.125 --> 0:26:56.208
        at this point.

0:26:56.208 --> 0:26:58.250
    - The anchor is ready to drop.

0:26:58.250 --> 0:26:59.917
- Remember, green

0:26:58.250 --> 0:26:59.917
to the waterline.

0:26:59.917 --> 0:27:01.542
     - Copy. Dropping now.

0:27:01.542 --> 0:27:02.625
        - Do these fools know

0:27:01.542 --> 0:27:02.625
    how to set that anchor?

0:27:02.625 --> 0:27:04.500
            - I'm gonna take this off.

0:27:13.583 --> 0:27:16.625
            - Okay, lock it off.

0:27:13.583 --> 0:27:16.625
    Put the anchor ball up,

0:27:16.625 --> 0:27:18.458
and then you guys

0:27:16.625 --> 0:27:18.458
        can start with the water toys.

0:27:18.458 --> 0:27:19.792
    - Copy.

0:27:21.958 --> 0:27:24.500
    - This is a Thai

0:27:21.958 --> 0:27:24.500
    broth--coconut, shrimp.

0:27:24.500 --> 0:27:27.833
    Last charter season was brutal.

0:27:24.500 --> 0:27:27.833
I was distracted.

0:27:27.833 --> 0:27:31.167
        But I got a new boat,

0:27:27.833 --> 0:27:31.167
new crew, new me.

0:27:31.167 --> 0:27:32.458
    I'll follow you

0:27:31.167 --> 0:27:32.458
            with the third one.

0:27:32.458 --> 0:27:35.000
        - Okay, thanks, Adam.

0:27:32.458 --> 0:27:35.000
    - Ready?

0:27:35.000 --> 0:27:37.292
- But champagne is

0:27:35.000 --> 0:27:37.292
        for breakfast.

0:27:37.292 --> 0:27:38.958
        - Ladies, real quick,

0:27:38.958 --> 0:27:40.083
        we just have a little

0:27:38.958 --> 0:27:40.083
grilled shrimp right here.

0:27:40.083 --> 0:27:41.625
        These are jumbo local prawns.

0:27:41.625 --> 0:27:43.833
            There's a little rice noodle

0:27:41.625 --> 0:27:43.833
            underneath,

0:27:43.833 --> 0:27:46.167
    got some coconut broth.

0:27:46.167 --> 0:27:47.708
Thank you. Enjoy.

0:27:47.708 --> 0:27:50.167
            - Thank you, Adam.

0:27:50.167 --> 0:27:51.708
- It's cooked perfectly.

0:27:51.708 --> 0:27:54.542
    The shrimp is fantastic.

0:27:51.708 --> 0:27:54.542
I love spicy too.

0:27:54.542 --> 0:27:56.167
        - It's good.

0:27:54.542 --> 0:27:56.167
        - It's good?

0:27:56.167 --> 0:27:58.000
    - Yeah.

0:27:56.167 --> 0:27:58.000
            - Chuck it in, then we, uh--

0:27:58.000 --> 0:28:00.042
            - Did they like it?

0:27:58.000 --> 0:28:00.042
            - They said it's delicious.

0:28:00.042 --> 0:28:01.625
    - Okay. Can we get on the line?

0:28:01.625 --> 0:28:03.500
- Conrad, the line

0:28:01.625 --> 0:28:03.500
        is on the other side.

0:28:03.500 --> 0:28:06.833
- I know, I know, I know.

0:28:03.500 --> 0:28:06.833
- Sorry, but that is such

0:28:06.833 --> 0:28:09.833
an obnoxious piece

0:28:06.833 --> 0:28:09.833
of maritime architecture.

0:28:09.833 --> 0:28:11.375
        - It's huge.

0:28:11.375 --> 0:28:13.375
    - I would prance around

0:28:11.375 --> 0:28:13.375
that ship, though.

0:28:13.375 --> 0:28:15.333
Thank you.

0:28:13.375 --> 0:28:15.333
I'm so thirsty. Thank you.

0:28:15.333 --> 0:28:18.000
    - Let's go boat-hopping.

0:28:15.333 --> 0:28:18.000
        - Hospitality checks.

0:28:18.000 --> 0:28:19.208
        - Hospitality checks.

0:28:19.208 --> 0:28:20.833
        - Hi.

0:28:19.208 --> 0:28:20.833
- Listen, Hannah.

0:28:20.833 --> 0:28:22.208
    - Yes?

0:28:22.208 --> 0:28:25.125
            - So we want to meet our...

0:28:25.125 --> 0:28:26.375
            - Yachtsmen.

0:28:25.125 --> 0:28:26.375
    - Okay.

0:28:26.375 --> 0:28:28.208
I will get the deck crew.

0:28:28.208 --> 0:28:32.708
    - Thank you, sweetheart.

0:28:28.208 --> 0:28:32.708
    - I like Hannah.

0:28:32.708 --> 0:28:36.167
            - What the (BLEEP)?

0:28:36.167 --> 0:28:38.042
        - [retching]

0:28:36.167 --> 0:28:38.042
        - Um, Sandy,

0:28:38.042 --> 0:28:40.583
        they want to take the tender

0:28:40.583 --> 0:28:44.875
            and do a "hospitality visit"

0:28:40.583 --> 0:28:44.875
    to this boat over there.

0:28:44.875 --> 0:28:46.250
They said they're single

0:28:46.250 --> 0:28:48.000
            and they want to go

0:28:46.250 --> 0:28:48.000
    meet men, and...

0:28:48.000 --> 0:28:50.042
        - I don't really give a sh--.

0:28:48.000 --> 0:28:50.042
        Take them on the boat.

0:28:50.042 --> 0:28:53.292
If they want to get laid,

0:28:50.042 --> 0:28:53.292
let them.

0:28:54.250 --> 0:28:56.500
        - [coughing]

0:28:59.042 --> 0:29:01.750
        - I never got seasick

0:28:59.042 --> 0:29:01.750
back home,

0:29:01.750 --> 0:29:03.708
            because the boats that I was

0:29:01.750 --> 0:29:03.708
        on never left the bay.

0:29:03.708 --> 0:29:06.042
    I really wanted to give

0:29:03.708 --> 0:29:06.042
    a good first impression,

0:29:06.042 --> 0:29:09.625
        and it's just not happening.

0:29:09.625 --> 0:29:12.542
        - I would like you two

0:29:09.625 --> 0:29:12.542
to take the guests

0:29:12.542 --> 0:29:14.792
to the hundred-meter boat

0:29:12.542 --> 0:29:14.792
    in front of us.

0:29:14.792 --> 0:29:16.083
            - That one?

0:29:14.792 --> 0:29:16.083
        - Yes.

0:29:16.083 --> 0:29:17.917
    They are going husband hunting.

0:29:17.917 --> 0:29:20.875
        - How do you plan that we go,

0:29:17.917 --> 0:29:20.875
        and--oh, my--

0:29:20.875 --> 0:29:22.458
- How you doing?

0:29:22.458 --> 0:29:24.292
    - Okay.

0:29:24.292 --> 0:29:26.042
Lie down, close your eyes,

0:29:24.292 --> 0:29:26.042
try and sleep.

0:29:26.042 --> 0:29:28.417
    - Okay.

0:29:26.042 --> 0:29:28.417
     - Hannah, Hannah, Kasey.

0:29:28.417 --> 0:29:30.125
        - Go ahead for Hannah.

0:29:28.417 --> 0:29:30.125
    - I'm gonna go lay down,

0:29:30.125 --> 0:29:32.417
    but if you need me, I'll

0:29:30.125 --> 0:29:32.417
    get in a minute.

0:29:32.417 --> 0:29:33.917
     - Just go and lie down.

0:29:32.417 --> 0:29:33.917
 It's fine.

0:29:33.917 --> 0:29:35.583
        - Thank you.

0:29:35.583 --> 0:29:37.125
            First stew that gets seasick

0:29:35.583 --> 0:29:37.125
            in perfect weather.

0:29:37.125 --> 0:29:38.625
Just what I need.

0:29:38.625 --> 0:29:40.583
- Okay, let's go, ladies.

0:29:38.625 --> 0:29:40.583
            - Thank you.

0:29:40.583 --> 0:29:43.583
            - There's champagne for you

0:29:40.583 --> 0:29:43.583
to take with you.

0:29:45.875 --> 0:29:48.917
- The entire idea

0:29:45.875 --> 0:29:48.917
of going husband-shopping

0:29:48.917 --> 0:29:50.500
    is absolutely bananas.

0:29:50.500 --> 0:29:52.917
    Give me a Xanax

0:29:50.500 --> 0:29:52.917
    and get me off the boat.

0:29:52.917 --> 0:29:56.500
    A- I didn't know skorts

0:29:52.917 --> 0:29:56.500
            could be that cute.

0:30:00.125 --> 0:30:02.083
        - No, I got to clean something

0:30:00.125 --> 0:30:02.083
            upstairs real quick.

0:30:02.083 --> 0:30:03.500
        - It should be fine.

0:30:03.500 --> 0:30:05.083
        Where's the sun cream?

0:30:03.500 --> 0:30:05.083
    Is that up here?

0:30:05.083 --> 0:30:06.083
    - Brooke, have you seen

0:30:05.083 --> 0:30:06.083
        the sun cream?

0:30:06.083 --> 0:30:07.667
- In the pantry.

0:30:07.667 --> 0:30:09.167
So did you take them

0:30:07.667 --> 0:30:09.167
    from their mystery country?

0:30:09.167 --> 0:30:11.583
- I thought my British

0:30:09.167 --> 0:30:11.583
accent was strong.

0:30:11.583 --> 0:30:13.750
    - My British accent

0:30:11.583 --> 0:30:13.750
            isn't strong.

0:30:13.750 --> 0:30:17.000
    - You guys have

0:30:13.750 --> 0:30:17.000
    British accents?

0:30:17.000 --> 0:30:19.958
            [laughter]

0:30:19.958 --> 0:30:21.500
- Okay, let's go, ladies.

0:30:21.500 --> 0:30:25.000
    - Look how big this is.

0:30:21.500 --> 0:30:25.000
            - We come in peace.

0:30:25.000 --> 0:30:27.833
            - Hi, baby.

0:30:25.000 --> 0:30:27.833
            - Hospitality check.

0:30:27.833 --> 0:30:30.625
    - He doesn't look happy.

0:30:27.833 --> 0:30:30.625
        - It's good champagne.

0:30:30.625 --> 0:30:33.042
- Absolutely not.

0:30:30.625 --> 0:30:33.042
            - Let's go to the next boat.

0:30:33.042 --> 0:30:36.000
- He's not happy.

0:30:36.000 --> 0:30:37.708
    - It looked like

0:30:36.000 --> 0:30:37.708
they were in a life raft,

0:30:37.708 --> 0:30:42.042
        just drifting between

0:30:37.708 --> 0:30:42.042
these two massive yachts.

0:30:42.042 --> 0:30:43.667
    Weird.

0:30:43.667 --> 0:30:45.375
- Are we ready to go back?

0:30:43.667 --> 0:30:45.375
- It's up to you.

0:30:45.375 --> 0:30:47.958
        - Yeah, let's go back.

0:30:45.375 --> 0:30:47.958
        - Absolutely.

0:30:51.667 --> 0:30:53.375
- Got it?

0:30:51.667 --> 0:30:53.375
    - Yeah.

0:30:53.375 --> 0:30:54.875
- Dinner's gonna be served

0:30:53.375 --> 0:30:54.875
    at 8:30.

0:30:54.875 --> 0:30:56.542
            - No, you have to wrap this

0:30:54.875 --> 0:30:56.542
            on that side

0:30:56.542 --> 0:30:58.292
            so that you get the pressure

0:30:56.542 --> 0:30:58.292
        to be able to,

0:30:58.292 --> 0:31:00.292
        like--I know better.

0:31:00.292 --> 0:31:01.708
    Wrap that cleat.

0:31:00.292 --> 0:31:01.708
    Here, hold this. I'll show you.

0:31:01.708 --> 0:31:03.500
- Nope, I can't have you

0:31:01.708 --> 0:31:03.500
touch the line.

0:31:03.500 --> 0:31:05.042
        - Oh.

0:31:05.042 --> 0:31:06.708
- If I go up to an artist

0:31:05.042 --> 0:31:06.708
            and ask them to draw

0:31:06.708 --> 0:31:08.333
    the worst person in the world,

0:31:08.333 --> 0:31:10.208
I think they would

0:31:08.333 --> 0:31:10.208
        just draw her.

0:31:10.208 --> 0:31:12.333
            - You know, I'm like a true

0:31:10.208 --> 0:31:12.333
        boater, and it's hard for me--

0:31:12.333 --> 0:31:14.042
            - It's okay.

0:31:12.333 --> 0:31:14.042
            No, that's awesome.

0:31:14.042 --> 0:31:15.208
    - I'm not used to having

0:31:14.042 --> 0:31:15.208
    anybody dock my boat...

0:31:15.208 --> 0:31:16.750
- That's awesome.

0:31:16.750 --> 0:31:20.000
- But the female captain,

0:31:16.750 --> 0:31:20.000
she's ---ing tits.

0:31:20.000 --> 0:31:22.208
        - Oh, my God,

0:31:20.000 --> 0:31:22.208
where's the spoon?

0:31:22.208 --> 0:31:23.750
- How did you go?

0:31:22.208 --> 0:31:23.750
        - Embarrassed.

0:31:23.750 --> 0:31:25.917
        - Oh!

0:31:23.750 --> 0:31:25.917
- Dude, they were like...

0:31:25.917 --> 0:31:27.500
    - But, like, stern.

0:31:27.500 --> 0:31:29.083
- Really?

0:31:29.083 --> 0:31:30.750
    - Would you ladies like

0:31:29.083 --> 0:31:30.750
some drinks or something?

0:31:30.750 --> 0:31:32.250
- I think we're just gonna

0:31:30.750 --> 0:31:32.250
        shower, change, and...

0:31:32.250 --> 0:31:33.750
            - Dinner's at 8:30?

    - Yeah.

0:31:33.750 --> 0:31:35.542

0:31:33.750 --> 0:31:35.542
            - Thank you, Hannah.

     Can you come up

0:31:39.500 --> 0:31:43.250
             to the upper pantry, please?

0:31:43.250 --> 0:31:44.750
            - Hello. Do you mind

0:31:43.250 --> 0:31:44.750
            helping out in the interior?

0:31:44.750 --> 0:31:47.250

    really needs some help.

0:31:47.250 --> 0:31:48.917
    - Yeah.

0:31:54.375 --> 0:31:58.292
            - Thank you very much, hon.

0:31:54.375 --> 0:31:58.292
            - Bullsh--.

0:31:59.750 --> 0:32:01.292
            - I have a couple concerns.

0:32:01.292 --> 0:32:03.250
        I brought together

0:32:01.292 --> 0:32:03.250
    a group of fabulous friends

0:32:03.250 --> 0:32:05.375
    who expect quality service.

0:32:05.375 --> 0:32:09.333
    Every time it came out,

0:32:05.375 --> 0:32:09.333
    it was something wrong.

0:32:15.000 --> 0:32:15.792

0:32:15.458 --> 0:32:15.792
- This is amazing.

0:32:17.458 --> 0:32:20.208

Is that your work?

0:32:27.958 --> 0:32:29.542
        - It's my work, yes.

0:32:29.542 --> 0:32:31.917

0:32:29.542 --> 0:32:31.917
    is just not quite--okay,

0:32:31.917 --> 0:32:33.458

            That looks like good

0:33:13.500 --> 0:33:15.750
            Buffalo mozzarella.

            - Sweet. Thank you.

0:33:18.333 --> 0:33:20.833
        - Yeah. Sweet.

0:33:20.833 --> 0:33:23.375
- I hate peacocks.

0:33:20.833 --> 0:33:23.375
    You can't even eat them.

0:33:23.375 --> 0:33:25.667
            Mom shot them when she went

0:33:23.375 --> 0:33:25.667
through menopause.

0:33:25.667 --> 0:33:29.875
            - So to start this evening,

0:33:25.667 --> 0:33:29.875
            you've got a caprese salad

0:33:29.875 --> 0:33:34.375
    with tomatoes, mozzarella, pine

0:33:29.875 --> 0:33:34.375
        nuts, and balsamic reduction.

0:33:34.375 --> 0:33:35.708
- This is so refreshing.

0:33:35.708 --> 0:33:36.958
            - Would anyone like

0:33:35.708 --> 0:33:36.958
    some more bread?

0:33:36.958 --> 0:33:39.042
            - I don't eat bread!

0:33:36.958 --> 0:33:39.042
    - Okay.

0:33:39.042 --> 0:33:42.000
        - The mozzarella was so fresh.

0:33:39.042 --> 0:33:42.000
    - This is well-seasoned.

0:33:49.667 --> 0:33:52.375
             - I don't want to let them

0:33:49.667 --> 0:33:52.375
             down, but, like, how am I

0:33:52.375 --> 0:33:56.500
        going to actually do my duties

0:33:52.375 --> 0:33:56.500
when every single second,

0:33:56.500 --> 0:33:58.458
        I just want to barf?

0:33:58.458 --> 0:34:00.583
- If you want to sit down

0:33:58.458 --> 0:34:00.583
and I'll talk you through it,

0:34:00.583 --> 0:34:02.583
tomorrow, you'll be better.

0:34:02.583 --> 0:34:04.250
- Brooke, Brooke, Hannah,

0:34:04.250 --> 0:34:06.083
            can I get you in the pantry

0:34:04.250 --> 0:34:06.083
            for service, please?

0:34:06.083 --> 0:34:08.083
- Copy. And that's basically

0:34:06.083 --> 0:34:08.083
what a turndown is.

0:34:08.083 --> 0:34:09.583
    - Okay. Thanks.

0:34:15.542 --> 0:34:16.875
- There's nothing I can do.

0:34:16.875 --> 0:34:18.250
- Hopefully tomorrow

0:34:16.875 --> 0:34:18.250
[inaudible].

0:34:18.250 --> 0:34:19.917
        - Yes.

0:34:18.250 --> 0:34:19.917
            - Order up, ladies.

0:34:19.917 --> 0:34:22.875
        - What is it?

0:34:19.917 --> 0:34:22.875
        - [inaudible].

0:34:22.875 --> 0:34:25.333
    - Your mom shot a zebra?

0:34:22.875 --> 0:34:25.333
            - Oh, yeah,

0:34:25.333 --> 0:34:27.250
it's on the floor

0:34:25.333 --> 0:34:27.250
            in the living room.

0:34:27.250 --> 0:34:30.542
    - For the main you have

0:34:27.250 --> 0:34:30.542
        a grilled branzini with lemon

0:34:30.542 --> 0:34:32.042
and caper sauce,

0:34:32.042 --> 0:34:34.708
grilled zucchinis,

0:34:32.042 --> 0:34:34.708
    and fennel. Bon appetit.

0:34:34.708 --> 0:34:36.500
    - Why is it in a bowl?

0:34:36.500 --> 0:34:38.583
            - Didn't everybody say that

0:34:36.500 --> 0:34:38.583
            we didn't want any starch?

0:34:38.583 --> 0:34:40.250
            - And now you have

0:34:38.583 --> 0:34:40.250
            noodles for dinner.

0:34:40.250 --> 0:34:42.792
- I'm sorry, my dog eats

0:34:40.250 --> 0:34:42.792
food like this. I don't.

0:34:42.792 --> 0:34:44.292
    - This should be

0:34:42.792 --> 0:34:44.292
            seven-star service.

0:34:44.292 --> 0:34:45.708
            - It's ridiculous.

0:34:45.708 --> 0:34:46.708
    - Yeah, I could

0:34:45.708 --> 0:34:46.708
            actually make this.

0:34:46.708 --> 0:34:47.792
    - Unacceptable.

0:34:47.792 --> 0:34:49.458
    - In a vacation of this level,

0:34:49.458 --> 0:34:52.417
I would expect something

0:34:49.458 --> 0:34:52.417
I couldn't cook at home.

0:34:52.417 --> 0:34:53.875
        - Hi.

0:34:53.875 --> 0:34:54.958
        - This is not

0:34:53.875 --> 0:34:54.958
        a dinner presentation.

0:34:54.958 --> 0:34:56.750
        - Okay. Sure.

0:34:56.750 --> 0:34:58.208
    Would you like the chef

0:34:56.750 --> 0:34:58.208
        to come up and chat with you?

0:34:58.208 --> 0:34:59.625
- Oh, absolutely.

0:34:58.208 --> 0:34:59.625
    - We'd love that. Yeah.

0:34:59.625 --> 0:35:00.708
        - Okay. Cool.

0:34:59.625 --> 0:35:00.708
        I'll go and grab him.

0:35:00.708 --> 0:35:02.292
        - I don't eat out of a bowl.

0:35:02.292 --> 0:35:04.500
- I'm gonna ----ing snap.

0:35:05.125 --> 0:35:07.583
        Um...

0:35:05.125 --> 0:35:07.583
- What's going on?

0:35:07.583 --> 0:35:09.292
            - They want to talk to you.

0:35:07.583 --> 0:35:09.292
- Yeah, it's fine.

0:35:10.625 --> 0:35:12.125
            - I shouldn't--well,

0:35:10.625 --> 0:35:12.125
        unfortunately,

0:35:12.125 --> 0:35:14.292
    the staff is seriously lacking.

0:35:14.292 --> 0:35:15.792
            - Hey, chef.

0:35:14.292 --> 0:35:15.792
    - Hello.

0:35:15.792 --> 0:35:17.458
    - What can I do for you?

0:35:15.792 --> 0:35:17.458
- I hate the food.

0:35:17.458 --> 0:35:18.917
Looks like slop.

0:35:18.917 --> 0:35:20.917
And I need someone

0:35:18.917 --> 0:35:20.917
            to open up the wine.

0:35:20.917 --> 0:35:23.500
            - And (BLEEP), here we go.

0:35:20.917 --> 0:35:23.500
            - I hate these [inaudible].

0:35:23.500 --> 0:35:25.083
    - The taste of the food

0:35:23.500 --> 0:35:25.083
    is good,

0:35:25.083 --> 0:35:26.500
    but the presentation for

0:35:25.083 --> 0:35:26.500
dinner--it's more

0:35:26.500 --> 0:35:28.792
        like a lunch service.

0:35:26.500 --> 0:35:28.792
            - Oh, okay.

0:35:28.792 --> 0:35:30.125
        - Can you get this wine open

0:35:30.125 --> 0:35:31.667
    and handle--and

0:35:30.125 --> 0:35:31.667
    bring champagne?

0:35:31.667 --> 0:35:32.667
- We were shocked

0:35:31.667 --> 0:35:32.667
        with the presentation.

0:35:36.667 --> 0:35:38.667
            - Never bring another dinner

0:35:36.667 --> 0:35:38.667
in a bowl.

0:35:38.667 --> 0:35:40.167
            - And then just kind

0:35:38.667 --> 0:35:40.167
        of ramp it up.

0:35:40.167 --> 0:35:41.792
    - Okay.

0:35:41.792 --> 0:35:43.333
- I want something

0:35:41.792 --> 0:35:43.333
that I'm like, "Ooh, ahh."

0:35:43.333 --> 0:35:45.250
    - This looks like slop.

0:35:45.250 --> 0:35:47.167
- And some of the people

0:35:45.250 --> 0:35:47.167
on their preference sheet

0:35:47.167 --> 0:35:50.125
        requested no starchy food...

0:35:50.125 --> 0:35:51.792
        - I don't eat starch.

0:35:51.792 --> 0:35:52.833
            - Ladies, you want something

0:35:51.792 --> 0:35:52.833
            that he can whip up

0:35:52.833 --> 0:35:54.458
    in a nice presentation?

0:35:54.458 --> 0:35:56.000
- I wouldn't mind another

0:35:54.458 --> 0:35:56.000
        little piece of fish.

0:35:56.000 --> 0:35:58.125
        - Grilled cheese with truffles

0:35:56.000 --> 0:35:58.125
        would be fine.

0:35:58.125 --> 0:36:00.000
    - Not a problem.

0:35:58.125 --> 0:36:00.000
            I'm gonna stop hanging out.

0:36:04.833 --> 0:36:06.625

            going on down there.

0:41:08.333 --> 0:41:09.667
    There's all this

0:41:08.333 --> 0:41:09.667
    awkward, weird tension.

0:41:09.667 --> 0:41:10.958
            - I have a couple concerns.

0:41:13.500 --> 0:41:15.167
            I'm getting too old

0:41:13.500 --> 0:41:15.167
        for this sh--.

0:41:15.167 --> 0:41:16.500
        - I'm not having a good time.

0:41:15.167 --> 0:41:16.500
- Really?

0:41:16.500 --> 0:41:18.583
    - Yes.

0:41:19.958 --> 0:41:22.500
[thunder cracks]

0:41:22.500 --> 0:41:25.292
     - This season on

0:41:22.500 --> 0:41:25.292
             "Below Deck Med"...

0:41:25.292 --> 0:41:27.458
            - Oh, my God. Yeah, buddy!

0:41:27.458 --> 0:41:31.625
    - It's like, "Sandy, you

0:41:27.458 --> 0:41:31.625
        know-a, we go to Capri today."

0:41:36.292 --> 0:41:38.417
- We're a little disappointed

0:41:36.292 --> 0:41:38.417
about the beach picnic.

0:41:38.417 --> 0:41:40.042
        - No!

0:41:38.417 --> 0:41:40.042
    - [indistinct shouting]

0:41:40.042 --> 0:41:41.792
    - No one is on the boat

0:41:40.042 --> 0:41:41.792
        right now.

0:41:41.792 --> 0:41:43.042
- This is a duck breast.

0:41:43.042 --> 0:41:44.958
        - Ew!

0:41:43.042 --> 0:41:44.958
        - Quack, quack, bitch.

0:41:44.958 --> 0:41:49.042
        There you go. I've never been

0:41:44.958 --> 0:41:49.042
        happier to see guests leave.

0:41:49.042 --> 0:41:51.042
            - I haven't had sex

0:41:49.042 --> 0:41:51.042
    in eight years.

0:41:51.042 --> 0:41:52.833
- What?!

0:41:52.833 --> 0:41:54.458
        - Why would you spill a drink

0:41:52.833 --> 0:41:54.458
all over yourself?

0:41:54.458 --> 0:41:56.000
 - I think he wants

0:41:54.458 --> 0:41:56.000
             to have sex with me,

0:41:56.000 --> 0:41:57.958
        but he can't.

0:41:57.958 --> 0:41:59.333
    - Having fun, darling?

0:41:59.333 --> 0:42:01.167
- I love being on

0:41:59.333 --> 0:42:01.167
            my hands and knees.

0:42:01.167 --> 0:42:02.875
        - Oh.

0:42:01.167 --> 0:42:02.875
            - [vomiting]

0:42:02.875 --> 0:42:04.833
        - A lot of people get seasick,

0:42:02.875 --> 0:42:04.833
        but they do their job.

0:42:04.833 --> 0:42:06.208
- If you don't know

0:42:04.833 --> 0:42:06.208
how to make a

0:42:06.208 --> 0:42:07.500
long black, how can you have

0:42:06.208 --> 0:42:07.500
barista training?

0:42:07.500 --> 0:42:09.875
    - I need to borrow a cigarette.

0:42:09.875 --> 0:42:11.875
        - Sometimes, you just

0:42:09.875 --> 0:42:11.875
        need to shush.

0:42:11.875 --> 0:42:13.042
        - Don't talk to me like that.

0:42:11.875 --> 0:42:13.042
    - And I've got respect.

0:42:13.042 --> 0:42:15.458
    - [inaudible]. Watch your head!

0:42:15.458 --> 0:42:18.208
When it comes to your

0:42:15.458 --> 0:42:18.208
emotional experiences,

0:42:18.208 --> 0:42:20.250
I don't want it

0:42:18.208 --> 0:42:20.250
to come up those stairs.

0:42:27.917 --> 0:42:29.375
            - I just want to know

0:42:27.917 --> 0:42:29.375
where you stand,

0:42:29.375 --> 0:42:31.583
where [inaudible] stands.

0:42:29.375 --> 0:42:31.583
        - Me?

0:42:31.583 --> 0:42:34.583
        - He's a ----boy who's trying

0:42:31.583 --> 0:42:34.583
to pollenate every flower.

0:42:34.583 --> 0:42:36.417
- You and Hannah

0:42:34.583 --> 0:42:36.417
have a relationship!

0:42:36.417 --> 0:42:37.875
        - That does not come into it.

0:42:37.875 --> 0:42:39.750
        - Can we have a salad?

0:42:37.875 --> 0:42:39.750
        - [inaudible].

0:42:39.750 --> 0:42:41.333
        So sorry about that.

0:42:41.333 --> 0:42:42.333
        - That's okay.

0:42:41.333 --> 0:42:42.333
        - Today, you're not giving us

0:42:42.333 --> 0:42:44.083
        descriptions.

0:42:44.083 --> 0:42:46.083
        - Service has sucked, Hannah.

0:42:44.083 --> 0:42:46.083
        - I'm trying my best.

0:42:46.083 --> 0:42:51.083
    - I never let anyone see this.

0:42:46.083 --> 0:42:51.083
    - Get Hannah back to this boat.

0:42:51.083 --> 0:42:52.583
- Oh, no.

0:42:52.583 --> 0:42:54.000
- I don't want to

0:42:52.583 --> 0:42:54.000
            babysit you, Conrad.

0:42:54.000 --> 0:42:57.042
        I'm ready to fire you

0:42:54.000 --> 0:42:57.042
            and Hannah.

0:42:57.042 --> 0:42:59.583
What the--we're in

0:42:57.042 --> 0:42:59.583
    a dangerous position right now.

0:42:59.583 --> 0:43:01.167
    - Oh, grab those! [indistinct]

0:43:01.167 --> 0:43:02.875
        - [screaming]

0:43:02.875 --> 0:43:04.750
         - For more "Below Deck
